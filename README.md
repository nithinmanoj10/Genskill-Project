# How to use

## Creating Tags <a name="create-tag"></a>

<p>First things first, let's create some tags. It can be any specific activity like studying, exercising, work, etc. It will help you keep track of your tasks. You can choose any color you want to match your tag.</p>

1. Go to menu (top right corner)
2. Select Tags
3. Click New Tag

5. Choose a tag colour
6. Submit Create Tag

_Deleting a tag will result in losing any data related to that tag_

## Creating Tasks

<p>Creating a task is really easy</p>

_You need to create a tag first before you can create any tasks_

1. Go to menu
2. Select Tasks
3. Click New Tasks
4. Enter the required details
5. Submit Create Task

<p>Estimated Intervals are the number of intervals you might use to complete this task. An interval is the active block of time in the Pomodoro technique. Later in the stats section, you can check if you're good at guessing the number of intervals required to finish a task.</p>

## Creating Sessions

<p>For each session, you can choose a task you want to complete and follow the Pomodoro technique. You need not stick with the 25/5 Pomodoro timer; you can select the active and break times you are most comfortable with.</p>

_You need to create a task first before you can create any sessions_

1. Go to menu
2. Select Sessions
3. Click New Session
4. Enter the required details
5. Submit Create Session

<p>Try taking a short break after every interval and a long break after every four intervals. It is up to you :)</p>

<p>If a session is over and you still haven't completed the task, you can create a new session for the same task and continue where you have left off.</p>
